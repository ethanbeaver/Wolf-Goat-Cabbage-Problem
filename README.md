# Wolf-Goat-Cabbage-Problem
A solution to the Wolf-Goat-Cabbage Problem for CPTR430("Artificial Intelligence") using a tree. The solution-finding algorithms are BFS and DFS.

## Problem

A farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a container of cabbage are on the west bank of the river. On
the river is a boat in which the farmer and one of the other three (wolf, goat, or cabbage) can
fit. If the wolf is left alone with the goat, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat is left alone
with the container of cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage. Your goal is to transfer everyone
to the other side of the river safely.
